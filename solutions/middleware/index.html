<h1>Enterprise Middleware Solutions</h1>

<p>Enterprise Middleware plays the critical role of integrating the disparate components and applications in an enterprise, thereby allowing them to interoperate in a reliable manner. Stimulated by the growth of network-based applications, middleware technologies have become an extremely important component in the enterprise technology stack. They cover a wide range of software systems, including distributed objects and components, message-oriented communication, and mobile application support.</p>

<p>As in collaboration solutions, the scale and complexity of integration varies with the requirements of the enterprise.</p>
